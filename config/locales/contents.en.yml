      paragraph_1:
        title: "The Social Network for E-Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software platform</a>, built
          by a team of Italian developers and contributors, to enable communities and groups to organize themselves in a productive manner according to the principles
          of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy" target="_blank">direct democracy</a> and participation.</p>

          <p>To achieve this goal, the application has been designed as a multifunctional system, which integrates all the tools that can
          help the development of a community, in particular "social" and deliberative tools.</p>

          <p>Among <b>social tools</b>, Airesis offers blogs and a system of promotion of events and meetings with adjoining scheduling.
          Among <strong>deliberative tools</strong> it includes areas for the collection and deliberation of proposals and initiatives,
          and a voting system aimed to the election of candidates. The platform also allows you to create groups with access regulations policies and customizable permissions.
          Since the goal of Airesis is to stimulate participation, great attention has been spent in order to maximize the intuitiveness of the whole platform.
          The development philosophy is focused on continuous improvement, a kind of evolutionary process based on users feedback.
          The development team is available to meet the needs of the communities which want to use the software according to the spirit of direct democracy.</p>
      paragraph_3:
        title: "Principles and core values"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis is an open source decision-making tool for e-democracy,
          strongly oriented to problem-solving and designed to maximize the immense evolutionary power
          of <a heref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" target="_blank">collective intelligence</a>.</p>
          <p>Entirely developed by volunteers according to non-profit principles, Airesis was created to take faster, informed, shared and participated decisions.<br/>
          It is based on the following principles:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Participation</b> <br/>
          Involving citizens means having more energy and points of view available.
          Only through direct participation it is possible to investigate the problems and understand what people really want. Participation is the essence of democratic decisions.
          </li>

          <li><b>Transparency and Security</b><br/>
          Without transparency, rules can be easily circumvented and democracy can quickly degenerate.
          Transparency also means openness, ability to receive: for this reasons Airesis also allows unregistered users to view the contents of the site.
          The source code of the software is also "transparent", being it entirely open source.</li>

          <li><b>Constructive dialogue</b><br/>
          No one owns all the right answers. Using appropriate tools, elaborating ideas proposed by many people can be more productive than doing it yourself.</li>

          <li><b>Equal opportunities</b><br/>
          To be intended as how effective equality, in terms of offered possibilities, can be pursued by the system.
          </li>

          <li><b>Flexibility</b><br/>
          Each group ha its own needs, each proposal is different from the others, each user has its own needs.</li>
      paragraph_4:
        title: "Our goal: direct and participative democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Structured as a social network, Airesis allows users to engage other people according to their interests and to exploit
          the qualities of each in order to consensually deliberate any type of proposal.
          The architecture and its core values ​​allow the platform to pursue goals of social and constructive debate
          on issues that may involve the territory, social promotion, sector policies and consequently to bring out the best ideas.</p>
          <p>Airesis provides tools to:
          <ul>
                <li>Promote the ideas and experiences of individual members</li>
                <li>Group the initiatives / proposals of individual users and present them to the community</li>
                <li>Provide tools for the debate on various initiatives</li>

                <li>Manage restricted sub-groups, governed by specific regulations and permissions, but with all the tools provided by the platform</li>
          </ul>

      paragraph_7:
        title: "Proposals and debates tool"
        content_html: |
          The core of the software is focused on the <b>deliberative tool</b> which allows you to participate in the drafting of a proposal to set a common goal,
          to contribute to the search for alternative solutions and to bring to the vote the result of this work so that the proposal can receive the most
          possible consensus making in the manner that the best and the most shared solution become able to emerge.
          <p>The process involves 3 steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The author creates the proposal</b> following a wizard as a result of which the system publishes the text in the section <b>in debate</b>.
            During this period, the proposal may be modified by the authors on the basis of assessments made and reported by contributors</li>
            <li>when the quorum is reached, the proposal goes to the section / state "voting"
            and during this time the text of the proposal cannot be changed, the author chooses an "event for voting" (voting period)
            among those already planned or may create a new one by the calendar,
            all those eligible (according to the rules established by the group), can vote during the defined period</li>
            <li>at the end of the voting period, the system calculates the votes and places the proposal in the "approved" section or, in the case of a negative outcome, rejects it;
            proposals may be subsequently revised and reintroduced in decision-making from step one
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Particularly interesting is the adoption of a discussion area for each published proposal that allows the proposal itself to be modified by the author (like a wiki)
          according to the consensus obtained by the individual contributions.
          The discussion area is two-levels indented, the first is designed to collect contributions , the second is intended for personal considerations on the latter.
          The first level implements a mechanism to collect valuable content by means of the incorporation in the proposal of the most appreciated contributions</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>valutations</strong>, defined as the number of people who have stated a choice (positive or negative liking);
            </li>
            <li><strong>discussion time</strong>, minimum discussion period (starting from the submission of the proposal);
            </li>
            <li><strong>maturity</strong>,  defined as the percentage of "participants" who claim to accept the proposal
            </li>
            <li><strong>minimum threshold</strong> to be overcome so that the proposal is not rejected</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The evaluation of "liking" (or not) of a proposal is a formal act of the members of the community
          (stated during the discussion period), through which it’s expressed the suitability of text
          and solutions to achieve the voting phase.</p>
          <p>There are different types of quorum: Depending on the complexity of the topic, the parameters (participation, liking and time) vary in consistency.
          For proposals published within the Common area, quorums are defined by the system administrator,
          while the quorum of the proposals published in the individual groups area can be freely selected by the groups administrators.
          </p>
          <p>The proposals are organized, sorted and searchable, in three ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>depending on their status ("In debate," "Voting", "Voted", "Abandoned")</li>
            <li>according to pre-defined categories ("Work", "Health", "Education", etc.)</li>
            <li>depending on the type of proposal: standard, regulation, estimate, statement, technical decision, etc ...
            </li>
            <li>by free tags, which can be entered in the text of the proposal.</li>
          </ul>
      paragraph_8:
        title: "Schulze voting method and Direct Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>When a sufficient number of people agree on the degree of maturity and completeness of the proposal and / or the minimum time set for the debate has expired, the proposal may go to the <b>voting stage</b>.</p>
          <p>At this point the proposal is frozen and the proposer will have to choose a time window when the group will vote on the proposal.
          The 'voting' event is recorded on the group calendar and is notified on several occasions to all involved members .</p>
          <p>At this point, each participant may order the various solutions according to their preference thereby allowing the processing of the Schulze method ,
          which will determine the solution preferred by the group.
          The solution thus defined will assume the status of "voted ", a condition where it can be resurrected
          (along with the proposal to which it relates ) for future needs aimed to revision and re-introduction
          into decision making workflow.</p>
      paragraph_9:
        title: "Promotion of shared proposals and Participatory Democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis was developed to promote the sharing of ideas and opinions within the community. To achieve this, the platform offers various tools and features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the <b>proposal is public by default</b>
            </li>
            <li>publication of proposals on social networks, the Common area of Airesis or on external blogs and forums;
            </li>
            <li>the personal blog in which community members can interact
            </li>
            <li>the possibility of organizing meetings dedicated to the members of a group or public for all
            </li>
            <li>the presence of a discussion board attached to each proposal
            </li>
            <li>reputation system that rewards participation,
            constructive and clarity, encouraging problem solving
            </li>
            <li>the opportunity to invite their contacts to join the discussion
            </li>
            <li>the opportunity to apply to become co-editors of a proposal;</li>
            <li>the resolution on the proposals through the vote of the certified members.
            </li>
          </ul>
      paragraph_10:
        title: "Temporarary anonymity, secret ballot and auditable voting"
        content_html: |
          <p>One of the peculiarities of Airesis is that <b>groups can choose if the proposals debate will be anonymous or not</b>.</p>

          <p>If anonymity is enabled, authors and commentators of the proposals are indicated by means of a pseudonym.
          This feature allows you to evaluate the proposals, criticisms and suggestions according on their content only, impartially,
          without the "name" of the authors and the dynamics of interpersonal liking/disliking influence the debate.
          </p>

          <p>In any case , at the end of the debate , and after the vote , the participants will be displayed with their real names so that it will be possible to verify the interventions of each of them.</p>

          <p>This option is also applicable to the voting stage, so it’s possible to choose if this will take place by open or secret ballot.
             Important, especially in the case of a secret ballot, is the ability to verify the registration of his vote and the absence of fraud.
             This is possible through the system of auditable voting implemented by Airesis .
          </p>







      paragraph_11:
        title: "Managing groups and user roles"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis implementa un sistema flessibile per poter gestire i <strong>permessi</strong> di cui ogni membro può
            disporre all'interno del gruppo in modo da poter imputare i seguenti <strong>ruoli</strong>: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visualizzare le proposte private</li>
            <li>Contribuire alle proposte</li>
            <li>Inserire nuove proposte nel gruppo</li>
            <li>Pubblicare nella Home Page del gruppo</li>
            <li>Creare eventi e votazioni</li>
            <li>Sostenere proposte a nome del gruppo</li>
            <li>Aggiungere partecipanti nel gruppo</li>
            <li>Candidare utenti alle elezioni</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Airesis consente ai gruppi che ne fanno uso di scegliere le
            <strong>impostazioni che meglio si adattano alle loro esigenze</strong> e ai loro regolamenti interni. Risulta
            possibile, ad esempio, consentire l’accesso ad alcune funzioni solo agli
            <strong>utenti attivi e/o certificati</strong>, oppure a coloro che hanno un <strong>particolare ruolo</strong>.
            Vi è ampia libertà anche sulla gestione dei requisiti che le proposte devono raggiungere per accedere alla votazione.
          </p>

          <p>Un’altra importante funzionalità è la <strong>suddivisione in aree/gruppi di lavoro</strong> grazie alla quale è
            possibile creare delle aree all’interno dei gruppi e poter imputare a ciascuna area dei partecipanti che potranno
            discutere delle proposte inerenti quella particolare area. A ciascun partecipante potranno essere assegnati
            <strong>ruoli particolari per ciascuna area</strong> in modo da rendere ancora più flessibile lo strumento. </p>
      paragraph_12:
        title: "I Gruppi"
        content_html: |
          L'accesso ai "Gruppi" può avvenire o premendo su ‘cerca gruppi’ dalla barra in alto o dalla colonna di sinistra della home page personale.
          <p>Cliccando sul nome di un gruppo, si apre la relativa home-page (presentazione + news/blog). Nell’area delle
            proposte
            sono visualizzate quelle che il gruppo ha deciso di rendere pubbliche, mentre per visualizzare quelle interne
            (proposte ed eventi privati), bisogna chiedere all'amministratore locale l'ammissione al gruppo. </p>

          <p>L'area proposte è divisa in quattro schede ("In dibattito","In votazione", "Votate", ”Abbandonate”), in cui sono
            elencate le proposte a seconda del loro stato. Cliccando sul titolo di una proposta, questa si apre,
            visualizzandone
            il testo e l’area dei contributi. Le proposte possono essere ulteriormente filtrate selezionando le Categorie o i
            Tag,
            in modo da visualizzare solo le proposte degli argomenti che interessano.</p>

          <p>Ogni membro della comunità può promuovere una nuova proposta: per far ciò basta cliccare sul pulsante "Crea nuova
            proposta", e apparirà la form da compilare.</p>

          <p>Accedendo all'interno di una proposta in discussione, i membri della comunità possono interagire con essa secondo
            le loro capacità, competenze e opinioni.</p>


          <h3 id="Spazio_comune">Spazio comune</h3>

          <p>Cliccando su "Spazio comune" si accede all'area destinata alla gestione delle proposte che possono essere di
            comune interesse.</p>

          <p>L'area delle proposte del gruppo si presenta simile a quella dei Gruppi; inoltre è presente anche un "calendario
            privato" che visualizza tutti gli eventi pubblici, più quelli privati relativi al gruppo.</p>

          <p>Nello Spazio comune è presente anche una scheda "calendario", su cui sono evidenziati gli eventi destinati a
            tutta la
            comunità (segnalazione eventi, riunioni, votazioni). Cliccando su una nota, si apre la pagina relativa all'evento
            e, a seconda del tipo, si può interagire con esso (es. partecipando ad una votazione o segnalando la volontà di
            partecipare ad una riunione).</p>

        title: "Destination: direct and participatory democracy"
        content_html: |
          <p>Airesis was born from the merging of two projects launched over two years ago as a result of the need to be able to use a
           computer tool that could integrate the main features of social networks,
           event management and online mass decision making system.</p>
          <p>In March, 2012, during the meeting "Five stars citizen" (Cittadini a cinque stelle) organized in Rimini, Alessandro Rodi
           with the Airesis project comes into contact with Nicola Giulietti and the Agora 2.0 project: on one side, there was a good software,
           while on the other side there was an excellent analysis of the features that a portal
           for participatory democracy should have been.</p>
          <p>Following this meeting it was decided to collaborate in the development of a common open source application so that it could
           implement the functions identified by the Agora 2.0 group in more than a year's work.</p>
          <p>The mission was (and is) still ambitious, but we know that it is possible to be achieved with the right tools, step by step.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our determination what initially looked like a dream of freedom, found the support of many people and the help of programmers,
           analysts, mathematicians, graphic designers and responsible citizens.</p>
          <p>Currently software releases are published on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to meet the demands and needs of users,
           in order to apply a process of continuous improvement.</p>

        title: "Why support Airesis project"
        content_html: |
          <p> I volontari di questo progetto impiegano molte ore per realizzare uno strumento al servizio dei cittadini:
          la loro disponibilità è ripagata unicamente dalla soddisfazione di realizzare qualcosa di utile.
          Purtroppo però, il volontariato non basta: servono fondi per mantenere un'installazione del software aperta a
          tutti, dove sperimentare le migliorie e le funzionalità che stiamo sviluppando.
          E' inoltre necessario avvalersi di lavoro retribuito per la manutenzione del server e l'assistenza agli utenti.</p>
